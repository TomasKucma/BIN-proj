## Description

Generates boolean circuits from XOR and 3 Majority function blocks, utilizing Cartesian genetic programming (CGP). CGP is a genetic programming algorithm, which generates solutions in the form of 2D grid of function blocks and evolves them by randomly mutating (changing) their function or their inputs. In this project, this mutation is additionally extended to simplify circuits based on theorem 1 from [a paper on XOR-MAJ circuits](http://msoeken.github.io/papers/2019_aspdac.pdf). Also allows for running the algorithm with standard functions (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XOR) for comparison.

## Project structure

  - `Makefile` - provides targets for building (`build` and `build_standard`), running (`run` and `run_standard`), cleaning the build and pack output (`clean`), and packing into a zip file (`pack`)
  - `src` - contains source files, specifically:
    - `main.cpp` - contains `main` of the program
    - `cgp.cpp`, `cgp.hpp` - contains implementation of CGP algorithm utilizing XOR and Majority function blocks
    - `function.hpp` - contains implementation of XOR and Majority blocks
    - `standard_function.hpp` - contains implementation of standard functions (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XOR)
    - `types.hpp` - contains defintion of types used in CGP
    - `examples.hpp` - contains examples of CGP configurations for various circuits
  - `cgp` - project binary, created using `make build` command
  - `logs`, `logs_standard` - folders containing logs generated by `make run` and `make run standard`
  - `evaluate.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook used for statistical evaluation of the logs
  - `plot` - folder containing plots generated by `evaluate.ipynb`
  - `build` - temporary folder used for building
